# Shark-Tank-USA-Dataset-Dashboard-Power-BI
I'm excited to present my Shark Tank US Analysis Dashboard.
I would like to share my recent projects base to overall KPI performance of USA base show shark tank. 
Going through this dataset to create visualization need a lot of changing within the dataset. I create DAX formulas, new columns, and new tables to get the desired result. For example, I create the new measure to find the total episode of total seasons. Therefore, I calculate each season episode and then sum up the whole episode of total seasons.
Created a new column to find the total investment using power query.
At last, I must analyze each shark performance. For these I want to create slicer of 6 sharks therefore, I need some columns in 1 column with additional values. I used power query to create each sharksâ€™ individual tables, change some data types to manipulate the values and need to require fill null values to get the all-important points. After that I append each table to one table then display the all-important visuals of each shark.
